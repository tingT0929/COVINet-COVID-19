# COVINet: A deep learning-based and interpretable prediction model for the county-wise trajectories of COVID-19 in the United States

- Developed deep learning by incorporating non-sequencing predictors to project the sequence outcomes
- Emphasized the covariates (COV) interpreted (I) by the deep learning network (Net). 
- To compare the performance of our model, we used the deep learning model for LSTM, and GRU separately and random forest as alternative tools.

## 1. Data 
### 1) Abstract
Our data source consists of cumulative confirmed cases and deaths from late January 2020  to March 23, 2023 which were collected from [New York Times](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data). The contributing factors related to adverse health were compiled from the [County Health Rankings and Roadmaps program official website](https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/). These data were available in their offical websites. This enabled us to predict COVID-19 in the United States using the interpretable variables associated to COVID-19 .

### 2) Availability
The data to reproduce our results are available.

## 2. Code
### 1)  Abstract
The codes incorported all the scripts to reproduce the analysis in the paper. 

### 2) Reporducibility
- Variable importance is determined by executing R scripts in the case of random forest results.
- To obtain results for LSTM only, GRU only, LSTM+GRU without covariates, and LSTM+GRU (our proposed model), the process involves first generating data using the Python script `data_pro.py` and then running the model through `lstm_cov_factor_server.py`.

## 3. Results

## 1) Variable importance

The variable importance results in the random forest are modeled based on the cumulative confirmed cases and deaths count, with the importance metric as the Gini index. The corresponding importance metrics have excluded the cumulative confirmed and death counts from the first 14 days.
